very simple implementation of 1D cellular automata using python and pygame.

mostly a basic experiment in pygame, and in abstraction to general 1D outer-totallistic rulesets.

ruledoc.py generates ruledoc.xml, a very simple xml file with each of the possible rulesets for outer-totalistic 1d automata.

note:  interesting consequences when playing around with the idea of state and antistate
