very simple implementation of 1D cellular automata using python and pygame.

mostly a basic experiment in pygame, left unfinished for now.

ruledoc.py generates ruledoc.xml, an xml file with some properties for each of the possible rulesets for outer-totalistic 1d automata

note:  interesting consequences when playing around with the idea of state and antistate
